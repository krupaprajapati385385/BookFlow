    <h3> Affiliation Restrictions: Users are generally not permitted to use e-library resources for organizations or companies outside the institution (such as a university or research center) to which they are associated.</h3>
    <h3> License Agreements: E-libraries often have license agreements with publishers or content providers. Users must adhere to the terms specified in these agreements. These terms may cover aspects like access rights, usage limits, and restrictions.</h3>
